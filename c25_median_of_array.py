"""

Given an array of numbers, return the median of the array.


Example 1:
    Input:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 3 is the median of this list of numbers

Example 2:
    Input:  [420, 69, 88, 365]
    Output: 226.5
    Explanation: The sorted array is [69, 88, 365, 420]
                 So the median is (88 + 365) / 2 = 226.5

Example 3:
    Input:  [0]
    Output: 0

Example 4:
    Input:  [0, 1]
    Output: 0.5
