"""

Given an integer array (nums), and an integer (target),
return the indexes of the two numbers in nums such that
they add up to target.

The result must be a tuple in sorted order.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
and you may not use the same element twice.


Example 1:
    Input:  [2, 7, 11, 15], 9
    Output: (0, 1)
    Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] => 2 + 7 = 9
                 Therefore, (0, 1) is returned.

Example 2:
    Input:  [3, 2, 4], 6
    Output: (1, 2)
