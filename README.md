# Python Practice

Designed to test beginner programmers on their python and programming skills.

1. Open a challenge file (files that start with "`cX_`", where `X` is the challenge number)
2. Read the challenge description and complete the function to complete the task.
3. To test your code, run `$ python run_test.py X` where `X` is the challenge number.
4. Observe the test output for feedback.
\
The `tests/` directory contains the test cases, but doesn't need to be accessed by users;\
test feedback will provide information about successful / failed tests.
